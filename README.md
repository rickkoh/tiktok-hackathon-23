# TikTok Hackathon 23

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

# Project Name

**TikBlog**

![til](./public/demo.gif)

# Elevator Pitch

**TikBlog** is a blog feature enhancing TikTok's content landscape. It enables long-form content, appealing to a broader audience seeking in-depth explanations and breakdowns. With TikBlog, content creators can seamlessly promote TikTok commerce products within reels, effectively offering product reviews. The concise write-ups also contribute to boosting TikTok's SEO, strengthening its market presence.

# Project Story

## Origin of TikBlog

As frequent users of TikTok, we enjoy consuming content-rich reels. However, reels can be too long, leading us to fast-forward and potentially miss crucial content. Conversely, some reels are too fast, requiring us to rewind and rewatch the content.

## Solution

With TikBlog as an effective long-form content type, we can consume content at a faster pace without missing crucial content. TikBlog will also appear in the commerce product as a customer review, forming a bi-directional link between Reels and Commerce.

## Success of Long-Form Content

While TikTok initially began with short-form content, it has successfully embraced longer video durations. TikTok has smoothly transitioned user expectations of reels to support long-form content.

# Social Network

In a social network, every user is a node, whether an individual or a business user. They can post, comment, like, favorite, and repost, creating bi-directional links between nodes. These actions are crucial, with varying qualities depending on performance.

## Widened Social Network Node Connections

Users can form bi-directional links with TikBlog between Reels and Product pages through their respective blog posts and product review sections. As the number of channels for reels increases, users will want to post about products to generate discussions and gain views from shoppers.

## Algorithmic Network

However, simply linking Products and Reels through TikBlog is not enough. To encourage content diversification and creativity, we developed a **Keyword Ranking** algorithm and a **Semantic** algorithm to analyze TikBlog content for TikTok's Reel Search Engine Optimization.

### Keyword Ranking Algorithm

The keyword ranking algorithm generates keywords from content and ranks their significance, ensuring content creators write concise and effective content.

### Semantic Algorithm

The semantic algorithm leverages big data to gain insights into products currently sold on the commerce platform, aiding better product curation with the help of the Social Network.

# TikTok Commerce Enhancement

Having worked with numerous companies to develop eCommerce stores, we've identified that the most valuable aspect of a platform is the marketing pipelines businesses can utilize to promote their products.

## Improvements in Product Review Quality

By creating a link between Products and Reels through TikBlog, this encourages high-quality review reels for products, helping customers make accurate judgments about whether to buy the product.

## Straightforward Pipelines to Conversions

With TikBlog enabling simpler pipeline conversions, businesses are incentivized to invest more marketing effort into TikTok, encouraging them to generate more content for TikTok to interact with users.

# How We Built It

We built the entire application as a Progressive Web App in **Next.js** and utilized **Supabase** as we are most familiar with web technologies. To build the blog structure, we developed a component registry library.

# What’s Next for TikBlog

While we focused mainly on eCommerce for this iteration, there can be various types of widgets that can be integrated. Some reels could include:

- Embedding Reels
